    "# Measuring Land Productivity with Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2: A Cloud Native Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud native geospatial paradigm has the potential to make Earth observation analysis accessible to more people, more easily.\n",
    "In the simplest terms, instead of downloading data before performing an analysis, it’s now possible to stream data directly from the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the steps required to query and load NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data using a Spatio-Temportal Asset Catalog (STAC), and how to use that data to investigate land productivity.\n",
    "Importantly, the benefit of using a cloud native approach is that there is no requirement to download and process individual scenes. \n",
    "Instead, a query is used to identify the relevant scenes, and then software is used to only load a relevant portion of those scenes into the computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use case: measuring land productivity for SDG Indicator 15.3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Sustainable Development Goal 15 is to \"Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\".\n",
    "Under this goal is Target 15.3, which stipulates \"By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world\".\n",
    "The relevant indicator is 15.3.1: \"Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area\", which has three sub-indicators: trends in land cover, trends in land productivity or functioning, and trends in carbon stocks above and below ground. \n",
